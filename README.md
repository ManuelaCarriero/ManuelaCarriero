"I have lost a bit of my sight, much of my hearing. At conferences, I can't see the presentations and can't hear well. But I think more now than when I when I was twenty. The body can do whatever it likes. I am not the body: I am the mind." <br>
Rita Levi-Montalcini, an Italian Nobel Prize laureate honored for her work in neurobiology.
